## Overview
KOY CSS Framework
KOY is a simple, flexible, and customizable CSS framework built with Sass. It provides responsive typography, font-weight control, and list styling for your web projects. KOY allows easy font customization and can be integrated into any design project for a cohesive typographic system.

## Installation

To install and use the framework in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the framework files.
2. **Compile the Sass** into regular CSS using a Sass compiler of your choice (e.g., `node-sass`, `sass` CLI, or a build tool like Webpack).
3. **Include the compiled CSS** in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

## Sass Compilation
Make sure you have a Sass compiler installed. If not, you can install sass globally:
npm install -g sass

To compile the framework:
sass src/main.scss css/style.css
